# //Tests

Run all the tests with `./runall.sh`. Each item is listed intentionally as a separate command.
Perhaps there is a better way to make this look like a test suite, but for now, this works.

See each package's Readme.md for an explanation

`./runall.sh` is run with `set +e` to run this as a test suite.
