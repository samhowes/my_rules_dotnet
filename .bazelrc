# Trick bazel into treating BUILD files under and e2e/* as being regular files
# This lets us glob() up all the files inside the examples to make them inputs to tests
# To update these lines, just run `update_deleted.sh`
# (Note, we cannot use common --deleted_packages because the bazel version command doesn't support it)
